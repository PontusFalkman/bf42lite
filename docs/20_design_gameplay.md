\# Gameplay Design (v1.2)



\## Core Gameplay Loop

1\. Host or join a LAN match.

2\. Select class and spawn point.

3\. Move, shoot, capture control points.

4\. Die, respawn, and continue until tickets or time expire.



\## Game Modes

| Mode        | Description                               | Phase |

|-------------|-------------------------------------------|-------|

| Conquest    | Capture and hold control points; tickets. | 4+    |

| Team DM     | Eliminate enemies; tickets = respawns.    | 4+    |

| Sandbox     | No objectives; test physics and weapons.  | 2+    |



In Phases 1–2, the focus is Sandbox-style testing. Conquest and TDM rules are introduced in Phase 4.



\## Classes (Planned Phase 3+)

High-level definition only; details in later phases.



| Class    | Role              | Example Traits                 |

|----------|-------------------|--------------------------------|

| Assault  | Frontline combat  | Med pen, grenade               |

| Engineer | Anti-vehicle      | Repair tool, rocket launcher   |

| Support  | Ammunition supply | Ammo box, LMG                  |

| Recon    | Scouting          | Sniper rifle, spot/ping tools  |



\## Weapons (Phase 2–4)

Minimal initial set:



\- \*\*Rifle (M1-like):\*\* Medium range, moderate recoil.

\- \*\*SMG:\*\* Short range, high rate of fire.

\- \*\*LMG:\*\* Heavy recoil, large magazine.

\- \*\*Sniper:\*\* High damage, low fire rate, scoped.

\- \*\*Grenade:\*\* Projectile arc, area-of-effect damage.



Early phases use one simple rifle; additional weapons and gadgets appear in Phase 4–5.



\## Maps

Initial focus is on a single small map:



\- \*\*Warehouse:\*\* Compact industrial space with simple cover and clear sightlines.



Later:



\- \*\*Island:\*\* Medium open terrain, shoreline, basic elevation changes (Phase 5+).
